Introduction
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a popular Python library for scientific computing. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions for data manipulation and analysis.

Getting Started
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine and ensure you have NumPy installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Array Creation
The following are various methods for creating arrays in NumPy:

From Lists: Create an array from a Python list and specify the data type.
From Tuples: Create arrays directly from tuples.
Special Arrays:
np.zeros(): Array of all zeroes.
np.ones(): Array of all ones.
np.eye(): Identity matrix.
np.arange(): Array of evenly spaced values within a given range.
np.linspace(): Array of evenly spaced values with a specified number of points.
Array Attributes
Demonstrations of various array properties:

ndim: Number of dimensions.
shape: Array dimensions (rows, columns).
size: Total number of elements.
dtype: Data type of elements.
Array Manipulations
Reshape: Change the shape of an array.
Flatten: Convert multi-dimensional arrays into a 1D array.
Indexing and Slicing: Access array elements, rows, and columns using indexes and ranges.
Mathematical Operations
Examples of element-wise operations in NumPy:

Addition, Multiplication: Add or multiply each element in the array.
Broadcasting: Automatically expand arrays of different shapes to perform operations.
Array Transposition
Transpose a matrix using a.T, which flips the matrix over its diagonal.

Finding Maximum Values
Finding the maximum element in the array and the maximum values along rows or columns:

arr.max(): Maximum element in the array.
arr.max(axis=1): Row-wise maximum elements.
arr.max(axis=0): Column-wise maximum elements.
Sorting Arrays
Examples of sorting arrays with options for different sorting algorithms:

np.sort: Sort array elements in ascending order.
Row-wise and Column-wise Sorting:
axis=1: Sort elements row-wise.
axis=0: Sort elements column-wise.
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
NumPy (Install using pip install numpy)
Usage
You can run each example independently or integrate them as part of your larger data analysis or scientific computing projects. Simply copy the code snippets and run them in a Python environment after importing NumPy.
